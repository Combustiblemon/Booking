fiters: list of tuples, each tuple is an operation. eg:
        tuple1 AND tuple2 AND tuple3 ...
        tuples should be:
        (parameter_name: str, value: any, operation: str)
    
        posible operations:
            eq -> ==
            lt -> <
            gt -> >
            ge -> >=
            le -> <=
            nt -> !=
